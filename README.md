a simple card matching game
This was my first project I made a card matching game using assests from one of my favorite card games 
Technologies used :HTML, CSS, Javascript
problems that occured: couldnt get my win or lose alert to pop up when its supposed to, the lose con is...actually sorta random

instructions 
 
 select a card then select another to see if its a katch 
 macth the cards as fast as possible 
 you win if you get all the cards as fast as possible
 you lose when the game will lock out after a certain amouunt of time
